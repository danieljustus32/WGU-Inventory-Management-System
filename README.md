# WGU Inventory Management System
An inventory management system Windows Forms app written in C#

This project was written as part of a final assessment in Software I for my B.S IT -- Software Development degree at WGU. Thanks for looking!


TODOs: 

- Connect to a database so information persists across sessions
- Add a "Quantity" field to parts so that products can consist of multiples of the same part without having to add the part over and over

No installation, just clone the repository and build, then run the .exe file.
